# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## Participants:
Axel Visan, Brooklyn Guo, Burhan Mirza, Danyal Ilyas, Ramzi Abu-zeinah, Saiem Irfan, Stanislav Kalynych

## Unfinished tasks and group them into stories:
 - Timetable comparison features (colour)
 - Connecting backend courses to frontend

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
 - Balanced work allocation across group members
 - Explain stories which are not started
 - Backend needs Documentation for all endpoints
 - Task assignment: each member should self assign atleast 1 task on Jira
 - Have more in depth commit messages with ticket number

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:
 - Scheduling consistent meetings (every Tues-Thurs-Sun, about 1 hour long)
 - Tasks should be more specific and smaller sub-tasks
 

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
 - Completing last minute doc files (SR1.md, sprint2.md)
 - Completing user stories last minute
 - Having poor manageament of time

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1:
 - Worst: Most group members have 3+ CS courses, it is hard to find time to complete work for the project.
 - Best: Seeing the front and backend come together
