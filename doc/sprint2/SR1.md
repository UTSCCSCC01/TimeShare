 - Balanced work allocation across group members
  

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:
 - Have more in depth commit messages with ticket number
 - Task assignment: each member should self assign atleast 1 task on Jira
 - Tasks should be more specific and smaller sub-tasks
 - Explain stories which are not started
 - Backen needs Documentation for all endpoints 

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
 - Completing last minute doc files (SR1.md, sprint2.md)
 - Completing user stories last minute
 - Having poor manageament of time

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1:
 - Worst: Finding motivation to work over reading week was hard, especially with assignments due and midterms to study for other courses
 - Best: Seeing the front and backend come together
