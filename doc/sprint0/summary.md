## Project Objective

This project aims to create a web application that makes it easy for UTM students to make, compare, and rate course timetables. The web application has the functionality to rate and  suggest changes so that students can improve their timetables as well as incorporate fellow students' timetables.


## Key Personas
---

### First Year Student
- Kayla Veena is an incoming first year student at UTM wanting to get into Computer Science PoST. Kayla is not sure about the courses she needs to take to get into her desired PoST, and she is not sure how to structure her timetable in order to create a balanced schedule. Kayla is also looking for new friends that need to take the same courses.
<!-- - Pretty fixed courses for each term
- Not experienced in building timetables (e.g. Taking 4 courses back to back with no breaks)
- Looking for friends
- Unawared of the required courses -->


### Upper Year Student
- Kowalski Petrowski, a 3rd year Computer Science specialist at UTM who has experience planning timetables, wants to create a timetable where he can attend the same lecture sections as his friends. Kowalski also wants to have common lunch break with his friends in other programs of study. 

  <!-- - A lot of variety for courses
  - Wants to be in friends lecture sections
  - Wants to have the same lunch break as a friend
  - Experienced in timetable planning -->


## Key Scenarios
---
### First Year Student
- Kayla Veena is building a university schedule for the first time and is having difficulty deciding which courses to take, and when to take them in order to have a balanced timetable. Kayle is familiar with VIAplanner to build her schedule, and reddit to share and seek advice on her schedule, but she wishes there was an application where she could accomplish both.
Currently she has 4 back to back courses with no breaks, and wants to seek advice. Kayla also is looking to make more friends in first year, and is actively searching on reddit for students who are enrolled in the same sections and courses.
<!-- - Brooklyn and Burhan, two Computer Science students at UTM, made their timetables for the upcoming semester independantly. They decided that they want to have more lecture and tutorial sections together, and the deadline to select courses is tomorrow morning.
- A first year student looking to get into Computer Science PoST. Most of the courses are fixed,  -->

### Upper Year Student
- Kowalski Petrowski is experienced with creating timetables, as he has planned many timetables up to this point in his university career. Kowalski enjoys being in the same lecture section as his friends, and so naturally, he wants to compare and incorporate his friends' timetables.  feels like it is a hassle to have to ask each of his friends individually about their schedules, make changes, and inquire with his friends again with his updated schedule, leading to a irritating cycle. Kowalski also visits r/UTM on reddit frequently, and comes across many posts from first year students asking about timetable advice. Kowalski wishes there was an application where he could easily rate and comment on their timetables, manage his own scheulde, and compare with his friends.

## Key Principles
---
1. Ease of use over multi-functionality. The website should provide a easy to understand user interface rather than overflowing with features that complicate the design.
2. User experience should be smooth and seamless at the expense of code complexity in the backend application. For example, dragging and dropping lecture blocks into timetables, and commenting on other posts.
3. Users should have the ability to rate students' timetables in a quick fashion (for example a five star rating system).
