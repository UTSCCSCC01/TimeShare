# Process

A couple friends along with a few new faces make up our group of determined third year computer science students, ready to make this project successful and fun. To keep organized, a Discord server was created from a template, with meaningful text and voice channels where relevant links, work, and plans are discussed.

Google Drive public folders, as well as Figma Board Planner is being used to plan out the projection of the project, and shared on Discord.

## Team Organization
---
We divided team roles in such a way so that everyone felt it was balanced, fair, and their roles played well to their strengths.

## Decision Making
---
When making decisions, it depends highly on the complexity of the decision. For example a complex and highly important decision such as delegating work requires all members input, whereas a smaller discussion can be cleared up amongst a few of the members if they deem it to be minor. When it comes to complex decisions, our protocol is to setup a discord meeting via our discord server. Our discord server is very organized and we have a channel specifically for setting up meetings. After we get everyones availability, we set up a meeting accordingly.  During the meeting, we have an open discussion where we all must provide our input. We will make sure that everyone has a say and have an open conversation. We will type/writeup key points and observations made during the meeting so that everyone can look over. Each big meeting we will have a designated scribe who writes down the key points.  After having an open discussion and clarifying key points, we will each vote on a decision and the majority choice is picked. 


## Story points and estimation
---
When assigning priority and story points, all members of the team must first read the user story before our meeting. During the meeting, we will bring up the user story and discuss key points that will be relevant to the difficulty of the story. These points include technologies used, complexity of the problem, and everyones experience. Using our past experiences and proficiency on the technology and feature being implemented, each member will assign a story point by typing into the chat. We will then choose the majority. If there is a noticeable discrepancy between the points or a tie between points, we will discuss again and ask the members why they chose to assign the story point that they did. This is important as we will not be averaging story points. Our story points scale is based on the fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ... ). The story points are not time dependent, instead they are based on the complexity as it relates to other stories (we compare stories against each other to determine how much "harder" one story is than an other). This is an effective measurement to assign story points.


## Meeting
---
We met every two days starting from the beginning of the sprint all the way through to the end. Even when they’re wasn't must progress being done during that two day span we still chose to meet to make sure everyone is on the same page and is on task. Initial meetings was deciding on how we wanted the website to look like and making sure everyone has a good idea of where we are going as group and then splitting up tasks so that every one has their portion of the work.

After every two days a sprint meeting would occur at 6pm a time when we are all free. Meetings occurred on discord, and we would go person by person and everyone would provide an update on how they’re progressing with their assigned tasks. They would then ask the rest of the group for feedback or input to make sure its inline with what we planned for our structure to be. Then whoever is presenting will say if there is any trouble they’re running into how they plan to solve it and if they require any additional assistance. At the end of every meeting anyone can speak and we discuss overall where the project is heading and make sure every one has a strong understanding of what is required.


## Next Phase (Sprint 1 and onwards)
---
For sprint 1 (and future sprints), user stories will be sorted in terms of both priority and difficulty.

Priority for the first sprint will be focused on getting the fundamental stories of our project covered such as viewing and creating a timetable. These are prioritized because they are fundamental as well as being useful (unlike logging in for example which is fundamental but isn't very useful).

Difficulty will be determined by relativity. Instead of trying to determine a time scale which is hard to assess due to difference in ability, difficulty of user stories will be determined by a point system. A task that is considered very simple by consensus will be classified as 10 points. Every other story will be determined based on how difficult it is compared to this simple task. If there is disagreement on its difficulty, this suggests that such task is poor as it is not estimable.
