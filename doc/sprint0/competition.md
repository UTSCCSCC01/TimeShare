# Competition

<!-- competition.md
● Short document (2-5 min’ read)
● Identifies existing products (and possibly provide URLs) that solve the same (or similar)
problem as yours.
○ How is your product different?
○ If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios,
■ Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
■ Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or
scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so? -->

## How Our Product Differs
---
There is no one single competitor, instead we are fundamentally combining key features of two direct competitors. To understand how our product differs from the competition, we must first understand how our existing "competitors" fail to bridge the gap that our application fulfills. VIAplanner is a tool students can use to better plan out their timetables based on course evaluation metrics that are valued. It is, in essence, a tool for "tailoring your University timetable based on your programs". Reddit on the other hand provides a social media platform where anyone can create a post, comment their thoughts, and upvote or downvote other posts in order to incorporate the idea of content ratings. 

**TimeShare** is a web application that essentially combines ideas from both VIAplanner and Reddit. Users will be able to post their timetables either publically, or privately to a group of friends, in order to get feedback, compare timetables, and get suggestions from the application on which lecture sections to move around in order to be in a section with friends. TimeShare aims to take the timetable creation aspect of VIAplanner, and the social aspect of reddit, be it through comments, posts, or ratings and combine it all into a one stop shop where students can create and manage their timetables, compare with friends, and get feedback on which courses to take.

## Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios?
---
Reddit obviously did not build their product with students in mind. They built a platform for posting, commenting, and rating, which aimed to appeal to a broader demographic rather than putting their resources towards a niche audience. In order to focus on these scenarios, Reddit would have to spend a lot of time and effort recreating a new app catered towards students, which would be an inefficient allocation of resources.

Although VIAplanner does focus on students at UofT, what it doesn't focus on is a group of friends studying the same program in the same year, who want to compare their courses in order to collaboratively contruct the optimal schedule. The reason may have been because they valued ease of use over multi-functionality, which are practices that a lot of developers go by. It would take a lot of time rewriting the foundation of the code to incorporate timetable sharing and a posting, commenting, and rating system.
