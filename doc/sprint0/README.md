# TimeShare

TimeShare is a webapp designed to help UofT students share their time-tables with one another

## Motivation

Students share timetables all the time. It's how they plan out their semesters so that they are able to spend time with friends in class, have leisure time out of class, and stay focused for the duration of the term. It gets a bit hard to keep track of all these timetables when sharing among friends which is where TimeShare comes in. 

TimeShare serves as platform where students may share timetables both among those they know and those they don't, at their discretion. It comes with a handful of QOL features, such as automated scheduling, and overlap highlighting, all of which make group-scheduling much easier. With TimeShare, creating an optimal schedule is as easy as can be.
