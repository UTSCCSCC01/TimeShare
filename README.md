# TimeShare

TimeShare is a webapp designed to help UofT students share their time-tables with one another

You can view the user interface/user experience on our [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/1bvtWX8yQhMnk1paH0t6c9/TimeShare-UI?node-id=101%3A273&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=13%3A110&starting-point-node-id=101%3A273)
## Motivation

Students share timetables all the time. It's how they plan out their semesters so that they are able to spend time with friends in class, have leisure time out of class, and stay focused for the duration of the term. It gets a bit hard to keep track of all these timetables when sharing among friends which is where TimeShare comes in. 

TimeShare serves as platform where students may share timetables both among those they know and those they don't, at their discretion. It comes with a handful of QOL features, such as automated scheduling, and overlap highlighting, all of which make group-scheduling much easier. With TimeShare, creating an optimal schedule is as easy as can be.


## Installation

Check the frontend and backend README's to run the web-app

## Contributions

### Do you use gitflow?
Yes, we use gitflow. The official release is found on the 'main' branch while the current development is on the 'dev' branch.

### How do you name your branches?
The notation for feature-branch naming is \<jira ticket number>/\<ticket-description> where ticket description describes the ticket and spaces are seperated by hyphens. If you intend to make a change to the docs or refactor something, name the branch docs/\<description> and refactor/\<description> respectively. Sprint documentation such as RPM's and other logistical files should be put under a logistcs/\<sprint_n> branch where n represents the sprint number.

### Where can I find active tickets
All tickets can be foud on jira

### I've created a feature! How can I get it added into the main branch!
First and foremost, make sure that your feature passes tests. Then, submit a pull request to the 'dev' branch. The 'dev' branch will be merged with the main branch when the core team reaches a consensus at the end of a sprint.
